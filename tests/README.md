###  Running Tests

We use **pytest** for unit and integration testing.

1. Install pytest (if not present):

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
2. From the project root run
   ```bash
   pytest

   
Pytest automatically discovers test files named test_*.py in the tests/ directory. Youâ€™ll see output indicating passed/failed tests.([turn0search20], [turn0search16])
